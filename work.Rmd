      before_body: work_toc.html

These are all the separte html pages for each work:
[work_toxic_beauty.html](work_toxic_beauty.html)  
[work_plastic_fashion.html](work_plastic_fashion.html)  
[work_fabric_of_community.html](work_fabric_of_community.html)  
[work_todd_sieling.html](work_todd_sieling.html)


I understand we have two ways to put all this together:

1. every work page contains the toc.
2. only work.html (this page) contains the toc. When a link is clicked the 
  content of the relevant work will be loaded in this page. For this to work, 
  I imagine we need a placeholder (a div?) for work content. 
  
####__TODO for Arian:__

Decide which approach described above is better and let Maryam know. 
(I personally think #2 makes more sense, but you know better and I like to hear 
your opinion.)
