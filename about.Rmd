To some things I find it hard to give a name. Like myself. Am I a software engineer, a “data scientist”, a poet? 

I have a masters degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Mining and AI. Not knowing how software and life combine, however, I left my tech job two years ago to become a writer. At the time I thought I would be leaving it all behind. Looking back now, I realize I’ve only been drawn closer to technology in ways I couldn’t imagine before. 

Today, I think of computers as tools which can help us navigate this complex life we all live. This position of making use of a computer to accomplish a purpose (navigating complexities) is very different from the position I took before (programming useless applications). By putting purpose in the middle, we are forced to find a way and that’s how we discover helpful technology, or build some.

The enthusiastic spread of data science, therefore, is very welcome. The availability of data and open source code means, for anyone who has a question, that there are effective and free tools to start exploring and to acquire understanding and wisdom. The promise of information technology, is not a dark future, in which Artificial Intelligence takes control of our life and only the wealthy, high IQ elite survive. The promise of technology is a future where we have understood and alleviated our (currently broken) relationship with nature and people, so we can all have a good life.
