To some things, I find it hard to give a name. Like myself. Am I a software engineer, a _data scientist_, a poet? 

Not knowing how software and life combine, I left my tech job two years ago to become a writer. At the time I thought I would be leaving it all behind. Looking back now, I realize I’ve only been drawn closer to technology in ways I couldn’t imagine before.

Today, I think of computers as tools which can help us navigate this complex life we all live. This position of making use of a computer to accomplish a purpose (navigating complexities) is very different from the position I took before (programming useless applications). By puting purpose in the middle, we are forced to find a way; and that is how we discover helpful technology, or build some.
