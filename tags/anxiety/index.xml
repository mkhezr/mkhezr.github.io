      <description>I shared the last post about why to write with a couple of friends, hoping that it wouldn’t bore them. It didn’t! And they wrote back to me.
 I first heard from Heather: “What do you think is the fear that underlies the anxiety?” She asked. When I read the question, I almost cringed. I had mixed feelings about the question and I was surprised to feel that way. So I dug some more.</description>

      <description>I talk a lot sometimes. I may keep going on and on, to the point of annoying whoever that might be listening.
