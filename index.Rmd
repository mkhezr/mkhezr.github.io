### __Hello__
I am a researcher and a data story teller originally from Iran and currently based in Vancouver. I worked as a software engineer for 6 years before taking an exit to figure out how technology can be a part of life. I use my programming and data sciece skills to explore answers to simple yet profound questions that arise in real life, like how are my clothes made and why does it matter to know?

When I’m not investigating a new question or writing about it, I enjoy throwing some kicks in teakwondo class, writing poems, interviewing people, and reading ancient books.

### __Get In Touch__
I am looking for collaborations and always enjoy a good conversation. currently I’m mostly interested in story telling through data visualization, word analysis and community detection.
